        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there. I'm Karl-Remy Paul, but you can call me K-R. I was born in Haiti and moved to
          America at the age of 3. I'm currently located in Cambridge, MA and am working full-time. My curent plan is to
          continue learning the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that I can begin working
          in that field.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hobbies are reading, cooking, and using my computer. Occasionally, I'll take
          long walks and listen to music to de-stress and relax.

        <h2>Why Pick Front-End?</h2>
        <p>
          The reason I chose Front-End is because it's the most familliar coding languages to me. In high
          school I took a course called 'Intro to CS' and it covered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While that was
          years ago, some of the lessons still remained with me as well as the site we used, CodeCademy. So in
          January of 2023, I made the decision to purchase full access to the website and begun my journey.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I'm still learning all I can even now but I am comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JS coding languages!
